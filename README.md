> This are personal notes taken while following the lesson of the course in _Network Analytics_, EM 1422, at Ca' Foscari University of Venice. Any mistake made is mine: as you might expect, student notes _are not_ peer reviewed and/or endorsed as official materials. I do not own any rights on this material. Feel free to write me at __solar-san@pm.me__ if you spot mistakes or have any suggestions. The source code is freely available at [GitHub.com](https://github.com/solar-san). Please share, comment, and leave a star if you use these notes!

- Most of the `R` code is taken from the required textbook, [_Analyzing Social Networks using `R`_](https://uk.sagepub.com/en-gb/eur/analyzing-social-networks-using-r/book271675). The companion website contains useful resources and all code can be retrieved from [the companion website](https://sites.google.com/view/asnr-2022/home).
- The pictures and tables in the [__Centrality__](https://solar-san.github.io/NA-Notes/docs/Network_Analysis.html#centrality) and [__Dyadic__](https://solar-san.github.io/NA-Notes/docs/Network_Analysis.html#centrality) sections are taken from [prof. Giorgia Minello](https://www.unive.it/data/persone/11535404) materials for a course about networks.

A special thanks to [prof. Righi](https://www.simonerighi.com), for this awesome course and for allowing me to make this material freely available online.

The final project for this course is available at [this link]().
